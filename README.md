# Reproducibility workflow for state space estimation of CTDS models

Code and workflows used to conduct analyses and create figures for the introduction of state space estimation of CTDS models.  The workflow is designed to be run partly on the [Duke University Compute Cluster](https://rc.duke.edu/dcc/), and partly on personal computers.  The cluster configurations are difficult to make completely reproducible.
